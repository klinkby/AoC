# Klinkby' AoC

Solutions in C# for [Advent of code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/).

- [2025](src/2025) use XUnitv3. This year with a dogmatic approach to minimize heap allocations.
- [2024](src/2024) use a single TUnit testing project for minimal boilerplate, and static bound inputs instead of files.
- [2023](src/2023) are a bunch of individual projects, one for each day.

> In respect to the AoC author's [terms](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) I do not publish his puzzle input. It is kept in a private repo 
that is a Git submodule to this public repo.
